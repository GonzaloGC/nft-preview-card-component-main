# NFT preview card component

This project was created using Vite.js, a fast and modern build tool for web projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you'll need to use the following scripts:

### Development Server

To start the development server, run:
```
pnpm run dev
```
This command starts a local development server with hot module replacement, allowing you to see your changes in real-time as you edit your code.
### Build for Production

To start the development server, run:
```
pnpm run build
```
This command bundles your application into static files for production. It optimizes the output for the best performance.
### Preview Production Build

To start the development server, run:
```
pnpm run preview
```
This command serves the files generated from the build command locally, allowing you to inspect the production build and ensure it works as expected before deploying.
